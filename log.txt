Hiccup(1):
Motor not rotating

Motor driver working fine

Measuring:
**vo = voltage difference between pin 3 and 4 on arduino**

when z = 254,vo = 4.03v
when z = 0,vo = 0v

Solution(1):
Connect the grounds of both arduino and L298N driver together

[log]
Motor working as expected 
Speed of the motor is changed
